# SCARINDEX (B6) ORACLE SPECIFICATION
## Supreme Economic Regulator & Coherence Oracle

COMPOSITE FUNCTION (P2):
ScarIndex = (Narrative*0.4) + (Social*0.3) + (Economic*0.2) + (Technical*0.1)

COMPONENT METRICS:
- Narrative: CTMS semantic analysis (contradiction score, thematic consistency)
- Social: Community analytics (satisfaction, governance participation)
- Economic: Smart contract metrics (supply stability, ache-price correlation)
- Technical: Infrastructure monitoring (uptime, error rates)

PANIC FRAMES TRIGGER (P3):
- F4 Activation: ScarIndex < 0.3 (critical threshold)
- Initiates 7-Phase Crisis Recovery Protocol
- Constitutional circuit breaker for regulatory realignment

DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
- Phase 1: Polygon Amoy testnet (immediate)
- Phase 2: StarkNet validity rollup (final ledger anchor)
- Oracle Type: Tendermint app (scarindexd) for deterministic finality
- Merkle root commitments to L1 for cryptographic anchoring
